bash
Copy code
# Run a specific module
python3 path/to/your_script.py
To run tests, you can use the unittest framework (or another testing framework if specified in your repo):

bash
Copy code
# Run all tests in the repository
python3 -m unittest discover tests/
Modules
This repository is structured into different modules, each focusing on a core area of backend development. Some key modules might include:

Basics: Introduction to backend concepts, working with HTTP, requests, and responses.
Authentication: Implementing authentication and authorization with JWT, OAuth, and other protocols.
Databases: Connecting to databases, performing CRUD operations, and using ORMs.
Async Programming: Understanding asynchronous requests, async/await, and non-blocking I/O in Python.
Data Processing: Parsing and handling data from various sources, such as JSON, XML, and CSV.
Each module has its own folder with dedicated README files explaining its purpose and how to run examples or exercises.
